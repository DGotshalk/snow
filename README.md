## installation

If you donâ€™t have a preferred plugin helper, consider trying [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), which can be installed with:

```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

With vim-plug, snow can be installed by adding the following to the top of your vimrc...

```
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
Plug 'nightsense/snow'
call plug#end()
```

...then restarting vim, followed by running `:PlugUpdate` (at the vim command line).

## activation

For a snow day, add the following to vimrc:

```
colorscheme snow
set background=light
```

For a snowy evening:

```
colorscheme snow
set background=dark
```

## status line themes

snow comes with themes for airline and lightline, with separate themes for each background setting.

For instance, to activate the airline theme with dark background:

```
let g:airline_theme='snow_dark'
```

For the lightline theme with light background:

```
let g:lightline = { 'colorscheme': 'snow_light' }
```

## rotation

If you'd like themes and/or backgrounds to switch automatically (based on absolute time or sun-relative time), you might want to try out [night-and-day](https://github.com/nightsense/night-and-day).

For instance, to use the light snow theme 6AM-6PM, dark theme otherwise:

```
let g:nd_themes = [
  \ [ '06:00' , 'snow' , 'light' ],
  \ [ '18:00' , 'snow' , 'dark'  ],
  \ ]
```

Or, using sun-relative times and adding lightline themes:

```
let g:nd_themes = [
\ ['sunrise+0'  , 'snow' , 'light', 'snow_light' ],
\ ['sunset+0'   , 'snow' , 'dark' , 'snow_dark'  ],
\ ]
let g:nd_latitude = '50'
let g:nd_timeshift = '74'
let g:nd_lightline = 1
```

## terminal vim

### colors

snow should work in 256-color and true-color terminals. You may need the following in vimrc:

```
set termguicolors
```

### cursor shape

To set mode-specific cursor shapes in terminal vim, see the [Vim Tips Wiki](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Change_cursor_shape_in_different_modes).

For instance, to set cursor shapes in vte-compatible terminals (like urxvt), you could add to vimrc:

```
let &t_SI = "\<Esc>[6 q"
let &t_SR = "\<Esc>[4 q"
let &t_EI = "\<Esc>[2 q"
```

...which sets the cursor to a vertical line for insert mode, underline for replace mode, and block for normal mode.
